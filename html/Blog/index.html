<p>The first entry!<br><br>
This is my first time doing this kind of thing and holy SHIT 
is there a lot to write about just for these past 2 days.<br>
Let's talk about the intersting things though, why am I doing this?
Aren't blogs overdone? Isn't all this just meaningless garbage that could probably be posted on twitter?<br><br>
Yea, probably. But posting things on twitter at 12 am on a tuesday isn't quite as much fun.<br><br>
I was pretty told I have no hours in the future at my job which is well, uhhh, concerning.
I really relied on that job to get me cash so now I have no idea what I'm going to do.
This fucking Caronavirus shit has made my life harder in so many goddamn ways. 
I have about 50 hours of vaction time which is approx. 2 weeks of pay, 
so I should be good for the next ~4 weeks due to our staggered paychecks, but I'm FUCKED after that.
Maybe this really will turn into the apocalypse and money won't be a concern in 2-4 months, but I wouldn't hold out hope.
If you are reading this from the future like some goddamn video game found note, then congrats,
 I'm doing that annoying fucking trope rn.<br><br>
ANYWAYS, I'm doing this because I found out like 12 hours ago that I don't have a steady job for the time being,
it's supossed to be a work night but I don't have shifts anymore, so I'm writing websites at 12am and I'm like 2 beers in.
Is this a good idea? no. absolutely not. I cannot hold my alcohol in any capacity.
but in the absence of any other good ideas I'll hold this path.
It's more productive than just playing videos games.... probably.<br>
I could probably be applying for unemployment right around now but that's a SHIT ton of paperwork and I am not in the mental state to handle that in this current moment.
I don't want to talk about work too much on here because<br>
.      <i>a.</i> it's boring<br>
.      <i>b.</i> I don't want this coming back to bite me in the ass<br>
but, these are difficult times so what better time to start a blog!!!????<br>
The caronavirus has gotten to the point where we have a curfew in place between 8pm and 5am in NJ so that's nice,
but there's the threat of liquor stores closing and my inner alcoholic just can't accept that.
The <i>GOOD</i> news is that the new Animal Crossing comes out on Friday and we get Half Life: Alyx on Monday.
To be honest this is kind of the best time for a quarantine to happen if such a thing exists.
The only annoying thing is CyberPunk 2077 getting delayed because I was <i>really</i> looking forward to playing that all summer,
but those plans are shot now.<br><br>
To be completely honest, I have no idea what is going to happen. I am on spring break but my professor for comp lab tech and web dev has told us ZERO plans for online courses.
That is concerning to say the least. Hell I don't even give a shit about my programming workshop or CyberSecurity,
those classes were a chore. But I do care about finishing school. I want to be done so badly and have a full time job and yet here we are worrying about a fucking super flu.
I know the website LostZombies.com got abandoned, but their timeline is matching up pretty much EXACTLY with our current COVID-19 crisis. Life imitates art style.
If people start eating eachother in September then it's proven that those guys were just illuminatti the entire time.<br><br>
I have no idea what I'm going to do with this blog nor do I expect anyone to read it.
 I think this is just my way of venting fustration and the <i>possibility</i> of someone reading this garbage is perhaps better for us all.<br>
 The world is very fucking scary right now and I don't know what the next 1,2,3,6, or 12 months look like, so I'm just going to keep writing websites and playing video games to keep sane.
 I imagine this site will change pretty drastically over the coming weeks in terms of layout, but we shall see.<br><br>
Until then, seeya<br>
-Curt
