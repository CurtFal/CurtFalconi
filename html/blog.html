First blog post woohoo!<br><br>
Currently just testing the waters with this so I'll probably add a better way to post these in the future.
Perhaps I'll make a new page for each blog post, depending on the average size of them.
I'm still pretty new to this whole webdev thing so we'll see where it goes.<br><br>
This kinda feels like a Diary to me but I guess calling the place you keep your personal thoughts should be called whatever you want it to be called.
I'm about a month into the whole no-job and no-social-life that is the quarauntine from COVID-19,
 and I suppose it's embarassing that it has taken me this long to finally get the blog for this website up considering.
I haven't even really spent much time doing stuff that <i>isn't</i> productive either, so I have no idea where these last 4 weeks have gone.
Lots of time has been sunk into homework I suppose, but I do really wish I was using this time more effectively.
Maybe that won't turn into a regret later on because it seems no one really knows when this is all going to end.
<br><br>Going on Twitter during this whole event really has been a nightmare in a lot of ways.
So many people who don't have any idea what they are talking about just yelling at each other constantly and it's really really infuriating to witness.
We also have a lot of people who just spread panic for no good reason, the /r/COVID-19 subreddit has been a good example of this.
"EVERYTHING is bad and we are all going to DIE" is their constant mindset and it is exhausing to read.<br><br>
But enough of that stuff, I'm sick of talking about it and I'm sure others are sick of hearing it, I know I am.
Recently, My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjUzKJeIrPASfnW4SMKbDw">Youtube Channel</a> has gotten some love, which has been nice. 
A gameplay video of Half-Life:Alyx did pretty good for me (~3.5k views) and I got lots of good feedback,
but then after spending over a month on a Beat Saber map I got negative feedback out the butt.

I mean, 3 downvotes is whatever, that's just 3 guys' opinion,
but for some reason it really annoys me since I spent so much time on that map while my other 2 maps didn't sink nearly as much time,
yet they got reviewed way better.<br><br>
I have however, managed to finally get around to some really long movies since my freetime isn't quite as chopped up anymore.
I watched both <i>Godfather</i> movies again, which are excellent. Finally got around to <i>A Brighter Summer Day</i>,
Which is a Chinese movie about the people who fled to Taiwan after the civil war in the 1950s-1960s.
It was nearly 4 hours long but it was super well done, could recommend it to anyone.
 Also I fully watched through <i>Band of Brothers</i>, which was absolutely incredible.
 Now is a very good time to start getting into TV and movies, lots of good stuff right at our fingertips.<br><br>
Well that's all I got for now, make sure you stay safe and drink water.
The world is a scary place right now but at least we have Animal Crossing.<br>
