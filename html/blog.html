Another 10 days, another blog post where not much has changed.<br><br>
Still no word on my actual job, which is a shame, and now my unemployment has decided to stop coming through for no obvious reason.
I tried to contact one of the call centers but just got told to "call during the next business day" so I'll try that tomorrow and start worrying if I can't get through then.
I also started to have a really bad cramp in my thigh last night and into this morning, and I think I pulled a hamstring which sucks. 
Going to start taking it easier on the long boarding and running until I am back to 100%. Icing and elevating it all day today in hopes that it will get better.<br><br>
In other news, I started my now annual summer diet and I've already lost 5 pounds.
 Currently sitting around 178 pounds and I'm hoping to get to 160 by the end of August, which shouldn't be too hard if I keep going at my current rate. 
 I've found that it is easier to stay under my calorie limit if I don't eat breakfast, so to ignore the fact that I'm hungry, I've started baking stuff when I wake up instead of eating. 
The irony is that all the stuff I bake is terrible for you.<br><br>
Brownies and cookies galore, but as long as I limit myself then the amount of calories I take in somehow still comes in below my limit.
That's all that really has developed in the past few days (outside of me watching a ton of Leone westerns), so I'll cut this entry short. I'll be sure to add more next time.<br><br>

Stay Safe<br>

Life is funny, isn't it?<br><br>
I have nearly nothing to worry about right now, I've finished up my semester with really good grades, I don't have work for the forseeable future and I have all the free time in the world.
<i>And yet</i> I can't stop worrying about some weird abstract problem that I think I have.
Sure, it's annoying not being able to hang out with friends or family, but there is virtually no reason for me to be concerned about anything at the current moment.
I think I'm just destined to be worried about things I have no control over.<br><br>
In other news, I finally got my long-board last week and started to get good with that over the past week or so. On Sunday I tried to teach myself switch and that was a mistake.
I ended up messing up my hand pretty horribly so it's been a struggle to do anything with my hand for the past 48 hours.
I have it bandaged up but there is a pretty horrible wound that I'll include as a spoiler if you want to suffer and see the gash in my thumb.
<div class="container">

	<div class="overlay">
	  <div class="text">(NSFW) My banged up thumb</div>
	</div>
  </div>
<br>
Of course, I still want to long-board more and eventually get really good at it, but the weather has been unpredictable anyway so I'll give it another day or two before I go out again.
It seems states are attempting to reopen businesses so the inevitable second wave is going to come and a lot of people are probably going to get sick or die.
Not sure how to feel about it because I'm not really an expert, but I doubt we'll ever see a normal world after this.
A lot more people are going to start working from home and a lot more people will be more conscious about touching others and avoid contact with other human beings I think, but we'll see.
A vaccine is needed pretty horribly but who knows if that'll ever happen, and when it does happen it'll take forever for it to get distributed. We'll see what happens.<br><br>
Other than that, I don't have much to report. I hope that I can see people again at some point, but who knows. Hopefully I can come up with a big project soon and get outside more.
I've started up running again because I need to burn off the winter fat pretty horribly, currently weighing in at just above 180 lbs so I'm gonna try to get that down to 160 by the end of summer.<br><br>

That's all for now,<br>

Hey, I'm still alive, incredible.<br><br>
The last 2 weeks were the end of the semester and I actually ended up getting a decent amount of work, but now I think I'm free.
The official end is technically on Thursday when I have a final, but I'm at least done all the projects that take a decent amount of time.
I think I finally found a language I hate more than C++, that being C. Like, I get it, it's fast and you can make a lot of cool programs with it, but it is so annoying to work with.
I've banged my head against the wall so many times because I forgot that you have to <i>MAKE</i> the code in the compiler before running it and it's just aaaaghhh.<br><br>
Luckily I don't think I'll ever need to use it again and I get to go back to using Java for my upcoming summer course.
After that I should be done with my Computer Science Minor and I get to focus entirely on Informatics and Cyber Security during my senior year, which is going to be fun.
I'm going to knock my capstone out of the way during my fall semester, which will hopefully be back on campus again.
Only class that I truly should need to worry about for Senior year will probably be that capstone, but we'll see where it goes since some classes always blindside me with how hard they get.<br><br>
It's also started to dawn on me over the past few days that I probably won't have a job over the summer.
I'm collecting unemployment, and the lack of expenses from buying lunch, gas for my car, etc. Kind of balance out my expenses, it would still be nice to have something to do.
I'm trying really really hard to not become some bedroom dwelling gremlin, but that is become increasingly easier to do.
Staying on top of the time I've gone to bed has done a good job of keeping me productive, and I'm going to try to start going to bed before midnight on weeknights so I keep some semblance of what day is which.
The mind exerts an iron will over the body and I'm convinced that if you treat every day as a vacation then nothing will ever get done, including hobbies or side projects.<br><br>
I also bought a really nice long-board that should show up next week since my skateboard really isn't in the best condition anymore.
That is mostly my fault because I beat the hell out of it, so I think I'm going to try the tried-and-true "have a good version and a bad version of the same item" technique. The name is still a work in progress.
Basically, I can continue to beat up my cheap skateboard from Dick's Sporting Goods because I will have a super nice Long-board from LandYachtz that I <i>Won't</i> beat up. We shall see how well this works out for me.
In terms of other quarantine sanity techniques, I had to get my mother to cut my hair yesterday which probably hasn't been done in over a decade. Virus really making the nostalgia hit hard I guess.<br><br>
Currently we are doing a test run in New Jersey for the local parks to see if there is a resurgence of COVID cases, which I'm sure there will be.
As if that wasn't bad enough that we have a global pandemic, we also have the crazies going out and protesting (flips through notes) uh, not being able to get a haircut..?
Like ok I get it, no one likes being stuck inside all day and being told not to go anywhere, but people seem to fail to understand that this is a virus that we've never dealt with before and the precautionary measures up to this point HAS saved lives.
Sure you can protest and whine all you want, but that doesn't change the fact that the virus is out there, ya idiots.
New Jersey and New York are kind of on the front lines for this virus currently so it will be interesting to see how this plays out over the next year or two for us.
We can only hope the vaccine comes soon but I think people are starting to realize that it is going to be a while before that happens. <br><br>
If that last paragraph was too depressing then at least take comfort in the fact that idiots have existed in the world before the virus and will exist long after the virus.<br>

<i>Thursday, April 20th 2020 | 11:07am </i><a href="#top">Go back to the top</a><br>
Another week, another feeling of existential dread.<br><br>
Somehow the lack of stuff to do has made my stress bend over backwards and make me <i>more</i> stressed somehow because it makes me feel like I'm missing something,
or that I could be doing more. Sure, you could always be improving yourself or exercising or studying or whatever, but you also need that down time.
I think I have too much downtime and I either need to spend more time with my current hobbies or find another one.
I spent most of yesterday just listening to podcasts which, while informative, has made me feel like garbage for some reason.
Probably should also be getting more sleep but that stuff is for the weak.<br><br>
There's also this weird phenomenon going on where it seems I'm getting less work as school comes to a close, instead of being super stressed out for finals.
I have only 2 real finals, everything else is either a project or just not happening, and it's really throwing me off.
If this keeps up I'm going to have to do some crazy stuff with websites or video editing over the summer because I don't think I'll literally be able to go anywhere.
I mean, obviously you can go places but you need to keep your distance from people,
which means hanging out with friends is out of the question and I'm not just gonna wander around a park by myself.<br><br>
The good news is that my extra free time isn't going towards just nothing anymore. Besides Sunday, I did something semi productive pretty much every day over the weekend.
I finally got around to <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> which was almost 4 hours long and it was awesome.
I then followed that up with the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie yesterday which was... a movie for sure.
I also banged out 2 more videos for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjUzKJeIrPASfnW4SMKbDw">Youtube Channel</a> that I'm really proud of, which is a nice feeling.<br><br>
People keep writing baking off since going to the super market is scary right now, but I honestly think it is one of the only things keeping me sane.
I've gotten a lot better at cooking recently so now that I feel as though I can confidently make a lot of stuff now is super comforting.
Although, I will admit I screwed up pretty hard on the brownies I was making.
The brownies themselves are fine, but I put this stupid marshmallow toping on them too, and it just ruins the entire thing.
Going to have to make them again without the marshmallow.<br><br>
Definitely going to use this week to start working out again as well.
I think I'll use the rest of my free time to break out my skateboard and go to the neighborhood over because it's been too long since I've spent an extended period of time in <i>fresh</i> air.
Sure, I've taken a weekly trip to the local brewery, but I should spend some time outside as well.<br><br>
As much as I wish to, playing Animal Crossing all day doesn't count as "being outside".<br>

First blog post woohoo!<br><br>
Currently just testing the waters with this so I'll probably add a better way to post these in the future.
Perhaps I'll make a new page for each blog post, depending on the average size of them.
I'm still pretty new to this whole webdev thing so we'll see where it goes.<br><br>
This kinda feels like a Diary to me but I guess calling the place you keep your personal thoughts should be called whatever you want it to be called.
I'm about a month into the whole no-job and no-social-life that is the quarantine from COVID-19,
 and I suppose it's embarrassing that it has taken me this long to finally get the blog for this website up considering.
I haven't even really spent much time doing stuff that <i>isn't</i> productive either, so I have no idea where these last 4 weeks have gone.
Lots of time has been sunk into homework I suppose, but I do really wish I was using this time more effectively.
Maybe that won't turn into a regret later on because it seems no one really knows when this is all going to end.
<br><br>Going on Twitter during this whole event really has been a nightmare in a lot of ways.
So many people who don't have any idea what they are talking about just yelling at each other constantly and it's really really infuriating to witness.
We also have a lot of people who just spread panic for no good reason, the /r/COVID-19 subreddit has been a good example of this.
"EVERYTHING is bad and we are all going to DIE" is their constant mindset and it is exhausting to read.<br><br>
But enough of that stuff, I'm sick of talking about it and I'm sure others are sick of hearing it, I know I am.
Recently, My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjUzKJeIrPASfnW4SMKbDw">Youtube Channel</a> has gotten some love, which has been nice. 
A gameplay video of Half-Life:Alyx did pretty good for me (~3.5k views) and I got lots of good feedback,
but then after spending over a month on a Beat Saber map I got negative feedback out the butt.
<figure>
<img src=https://i.imgur.com/VqmA61e.png" width="900px"></img><br>
<figcaption>The map in question</figcaption>
</figure>
I mean, 3 downvotes is whatever, that's just 3 guys' opinion,
but for some reason it really annoys me since I spent so much time on that map while my other 2 maps didn't sink nearly as much time,
yet they got reviewed way better.<br><br>
I have however, managed to finally get around to some really long movies since my free time isn't quite as chopped up anymore.
I watched both <i>Godfather</i> movies again, which are excellent. Finally got around to <i>A Brighter Summer Day</i>,
Which is a Chinese movie about the people who fled to Taiwan after the civil war in the 1950s-1960s.
It was nearly 4 hours long but it was super well done, could recommend it to anyone.
 Also I fully watched through <i>Band of Brothers</i>, which was absolutely incredible.
 Now is a very good time to start getting into TV and movies, lots of good stuff right at our fingertips.<br><br>
Well that's all I got for now, make sure you stay safe and drink water.
The world is a scary place right now but at least we have Animal Crossing.<br>
