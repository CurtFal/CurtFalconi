I am currently a student at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey. 
I am a Junior pursusing a Bachelors Degree with an expected graduation date of <u>June 2021</u>.
My degree will have a major of <u>Computing and Informatics</u>, with a minor in <u>Computer Science</u>, and a focus in <u>Cyber Security</u>.<br><br>

Currently, I work part-time at the University's <u>Technology Assistance Center</u> as a Student Technician Manager,
where my duties consist of working directly with customers to resolve various technology related issues,
as well as managing the rest of the student IT team.
We work with many different popular systems and softwares around the university,
including Two-Factor Authentication, User Encryption, Network Profiles, OS imaging, and more.<br><br>

In my freetime, I enjoy developing websites for various different uses, such as a website for <a href="http://carktube.com">Video Hosting</a>
that I created since Youtube was severly limiting the bitrate on my videos, as well as other various projects that are just-for-fun.
I also spend lots of free time playing various different video games, my favorites being the <i>Max Payne</i> series, <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i>,
and <i>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege.</i> I'm also an avid movie fan and I'm very active on <a href=https://letterboxd.com/Curt924/>Letterboxd</a>
and try to log at least one movie a week.<br><br>

Other miscellaneous skills of mine include Video Game Modding, Photo & Video Editing and Desktop Building/Repair.<br>
